# React + TypeScript Learning Projects

This repository contains a curated set of React + TypeScript projects built progressively from beginner to intermediate level.  
Each project focuses on **specific frontend concepts**, clean architecture, and real-world patterns rather than toy examples.

The goal of this repo is:
- To strengthen React fundamentals
- To practice TypeScript in real components
- To build interview-ready frontend projects
